    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\n(reprinted from abstract)\nExplaining the decision process of machine learning algorithms is nowadays crucial for both model‚Äôs performance enhancement and human comprehension. This can be achieved by assessing the variable importance of single variables, even for high-capacity non-linear methods, e.g.¬†Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). While only removal-based approaches, such as Permutation Importance (PI), can bring statistical validity, they return misleading results when variables are correlated. Conditional Permutation Importance (CPI) bypasses PI‚Äôs limitations in such cases. However, in high-dimensional settings, where high correlations between the variables cancel their conditional importance, the use of CPI as well as other methods leads to unreliable results, besides prohibitive computation costs. Grouping variables statistically via clustering or some prior knowledge gains some power back and leads to better interpretations. In this work, we introduce BCPI (Block-Based Conditional Permutation Importance), a new generic framework for variable importance computation with statistical guarantees handling both single and group cases. Furthermore, as handling groups with high cardinality (such as a set of observations of a given modality) are both time-consuming and resource-intensive, we also introduce a new stacking approach extending the DNN architecture with sub-linear layers adapted to the group structure. We show that the ensuing approach extended with stacking controls the type-I error even with highly-correlated groups and shows top accuracy across benchmarks. Furthermore, we perform a real-world data analysis in a large-scale medical dataset where we aim to show the consistency between our results and the literature for a biomarker prediction.\n(Twitter/X)\n\n\n;document.getElementById(\"tweet-11701\").innerHTML = tweet[\"html\"];"

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\n(reprinted from the published abstract.)\n\nBackground\nElectroencephalography (EEG) is increasingly used for monitoring the depth of general anaesthesia, but EEG data from general anaesthesia monitoring are rarely reused for research. Here, we explored repurposing EEG monitoring from general anaesthesia for brain-age modelling using machine learning. We hypothesised that brain age estimated from EEG during general anaesthesia is associated with perioperative risk.\n\n\nMethods\nWe reanalysed four-electrode EEGs of 323 patients under stable propofol or sevoflurane anaesthesia to study four EEG signatures (95% of EEG power &lt;8‚Äì13 Hz) for age prediction: total power, alpha-band power (8‚Äì13 Hz), power spectrum, and spatial patterns in frequency bands. We constructed age-prediction models from EEGs of a healthy reference group (ASA 1 or 2) during propofol anaesthesia. Although all signatures were informative, state-of-the-art age-prediction performance was unlocked by parsing spatial patterns across electrodes along the entire power spectrum (mean absolute error=8.2 yr; R2=0.65).\n\n\nResults\nClinical exploration in ASA 1 or 2 patients revealed that brain age was positively correlated with intraoperative burst suppression, a risk factor for general anaesthesia complications. Surprisingly, brain age was negatively correlated with burst suppression in patients with higher ASA scores, suggesting hidden confounders. Secondary analyses revealed that age-related EEG signatures were specific to propofol anaesthesia, reflected by limited model generalisation to anaesthesia maintained with sevoflurane.\n\n\nConclusions\nAlthough EEG from general anaesthesia may enable state-of-the-art age prediction, differences between anaesthetic drugs can impact the effectiveness and validity of brain-age models. To unleash the dormant potential of EEG monitoring for clinical research, larger datasets from heterogeneous populations with precisely documented drug dosage will be essential."

    "title": "Harmonizing and aligning M/EEG datasets with covariance-based techniques to enhance predictive regression modeling",
    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\n(from the initial bioRxiv abstract)\nNeuroscience studies face challenges in gathering large datasets, which limits the use of machine learning (ML) approaches. One possible solution is to incorporate additional data from large public datasets; however, data collected in different contexts often exhibit systematic differences called dataset shifts. Various factors, e.g., site, device type, experimental protocol, or social characteristics, can lead to substantial divergence of brain signals that can hinder the success of ML across datasets. In this work, we focus on dataset shifts in recordings of brain activity using MEG and EEG. State-of-the-art predictive approaches on M/EEG signals classically represent the data by covariance matrices. Model-based dataset alignment methods can leverage the geometry of covariance matrices, leading to three steps: recentering, re-scaling, and rotation correction. This work explains theoretically how differences in brain activity, anatomy, or device configuration lead to certain shifts in data covariances. Using controlled simulations, the different alignment methods are evaluated. Their practical relevance is evaluated for brain age prediction on one MEG dataset (Cam-CAN, n=646) and two EEG datasets (TUAB, n=1385; LEMON, n=213). When the target sample included recordings from the same subjects with a different task among the same dataset, paired rotation correction was essential (Embedded Image (rest-passive) or +0.17 (rest-smt)). When the target dataset included new subjects and a new task, re-centering led to improved performance (Embedded Image for rest-passive, Embedded Image for rest-smt). For generalization to an independent dataset sampled from a different population and recorded with a different device, re-centering was necessary to achieve brain age prediction performance close to within domain prediction performance. This study demonstrates that the generalization of M/EEG-based regression models across datasets can be substantially enhanced by applying domain adaptation procedures that can statistically harmonize diverse datasets."

Importantly, in biomarker applications of EEG, genetics, medical conditions or medication not only affect the brain but also different body systems, leading to consequential signal mixing (Figure¬†1 a). Previous work on predictive regression modeling (D. Sabbagh et al. 2019; David Sabbagh et al. 2020) has a term for noise but does not handle predictive non-brain signals. Here we extended the generative model and thereby convinced ourselves that without precautions, #ML models will pick up whatever predictive signal is found ‚Äì whether from the brain or the body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that figure numbering deviates in this document from the paper, hence, where needed, the original figure number in parentheses in figure captions.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan we find evidence for contamination of ML models for EEG by predictive artifacts generated by body signals or even quantify it? In this work, we upgraded the previous covariance-based pipelines to use Morlet Wavelets as in (Hipp et al. 2012). This enabled head-to-head comparisons between well-established EEG biomarker methods focusing on the log-power spectrum (Frohlich et al. 2019b, 2019a, 2019c; Hawellek et al. 2022; Hipp, Knoflach, et al. 2021; Forsyth et al. 2018; Hipp, Frohlich, et al. 2021) and #ML models based on covariance matrices (David Sabbagh et al. 2020) as representations (Figure¬†1 b). We then got inspired to systematically explore the impact of #EEG artifact removal on different covariance-based models as well as a simple artificial neural network ‚Äì the ShallowNet by (Schirrmeister et al. 2017) on two large datasets, TDBRAIN and TUAB for 2 model tasks, i.e., age- and sex-prediction (Figure¬†1 b). Moreover, we developed several practical sensitivity analyses to gauge the extent of signal mixing in predictive models to help identify the brain-specific information captured by the model (more on that below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Conceptual framework\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing the impact of basic denoising via Autoreject VS ICA-based cleaning of bodily artifacts on the prediction performance of the classical covariance-based models from (David Sabbagh et al. 2020) and the ShallowNet (Schirrmeister et al. 2017) revealed a striking pattern (Figure¬†2). Some denoising improves model performance (especially for weak models) whereas ICA-based cleaning can hurt performance! What is behind that? Are those artifact components removed by ICA predictive?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: (Fig 2) Impact of preprocessing\n\n\n\nDeep dive via Figure¬†3. Just to be sure, Autoreject does not remove eye blinks whereas ICA does. This is seen most clearly on covariances and power topographies around 2Hz. So what is going on here? (Btw. an example of how our Morlet Wavelet approach allowed us to read out and compare different popular EEG descriptors for the same wavelets at the same frequencies).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: (Fig. S4) Impact of preprocessing on EEG features\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne way to figure out if artifacts are predictive is using ICA to isolate non-brain sources and reconstruct the same EEG features from that subspace. We see that artifact components show some co-variation with age and sex (Figure¬†4). As hypothesized, sex- and age-prediction is possible from those components. Calmingly, the performance for clean EEG is higher than for those artifact-derived EEG signals. Btw. if you are into stats, checkout our theoretical expansion of the Sabbagh et al.¬†generative model that we used to motivate this analysis, eqs. 1-3 & 14-15 in the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: (Fig. 4) Subspace estimation via ICA\n\n\n\nIf you have auxiliary channels (EMG, EOG, ECG, etc.), as was the case with the highly controlled EEG recordings from the TDBRAIN dataset, another route for probing this point is doing a same-analysis sort of approach ‚Äì as in (G√∂rgen et al. 2018)‚Äì by computing the same EEG features from those AUX channels (Figure¬†5). A similar story unfolds, pointing at predictive information in AUX channels, in particular EOG. Ok now you might think that what we see here is some imperfect subspace estimation, leading to residual brain signals on AUX channels or in ICA components. This cannot be entirely excluded but on the other hand, we have prior knowledge about body-signal changes in different medical conditions leading to changes in artifact load. A careful view would, hence, be to see these estimates here as some form of upper bound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5: (Fig. 5) Subspace estimation via AUX channels\n\n\n\nWe can regardless dig deeper and work harder to isolate specific artifacts (thank you unknown reviewers for motivating us!). Here we used the EOG channels in TDBRAIN to extract eye-blink times. We then use evoked-response methodology to suppress the non-timelocked background brain activity (Figure¬†6). We can then plug the EEG topographies at the maximum (which is the even time) into a linear decoder. To look behind trivial effects of blink-frequency, we repeat our analysis across subsamples of numbers of eye blinks and what we see remains the same: The spatial electrical propagation patterns induced by eye blinks are predictive of age and sex. (And the performance values fall within the upper bound provided by the previous analyses.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6: (Fig. 5) Isolation of EOG artifacts via time-locked analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime for looking at what else the tools powering our study can offer to support exploration. Here we benefit from the high-resolution grid of wavelets to explore the spectral specificity of our covariance-based prediction models (Figure¬†7). We can do that frequency-wise (individual, blue, left subplots) or pooling over 5 neighboring frequencies e.g.¬†for picking up predictive edge effects (average, orange, left subplots). Across tasks and datasets, using multiple neighboring frequencies adds information. However, we can rule trivial broadband effects (right hand, orange, average) as performance degrades substantially when averaging over frequencies. Moreover, combining all frequencies led to the best performance (right hand, blue, individual). While some information is concentrated between 4-16Hz, these results suggest that information is widely distributed for these tasks and may contain not only oscillatory information coming from brain-rhythms but also anatomical information revealed by the spatial patterns resulting from electrical propagation. On this point, check out the excellent study by (Jochmann et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7: (Fig. 6) Spectral profiling using Morlet Wavelets\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may wonder by now, how our covariance-based models with Morlet wavelets compare to previous versions using bandpass filtering in conventional frequency bands. We did not have a strong desired outcome here but loosely conjectured that continuous frequencies with log-linear smoothing via Morlet wavelet-families might provide a good prior for capturing the frequency-specific smoothness of brain rhythms. We see in practice (Figure¬†8 a) that decoding with Morlet wavelets most of the time was leading to improved performance! And the sensitivity analysis in figure (Figure¬†8 b) shows that this is not trivially driven by the increased number of frequencies coming with the wavelet approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†8: (Fig. S1) Wavelet performance VS bandpass filter\n\n\n\nThanks to one unknown reviewer, we even went the extra mile to see if this comes from the wavelet design itself (complex Gabor wavelet) or if it comes from logarithmic frequency placing and smoothing that defines Morlet wavelet families. To investigate this point, we computed another wavelet family with a linear frequency grid (hence no log-linear smoothing). Indeed, corroborating our initial intuition, the log-linear smoothing that comes with Morlet wavelets significantly improves performance (most of the time)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†9: (Fig. S2) Morlet wavelet performance VS linear spaced wavelets\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne more thing.

Moreover, we developed several practical sensitivity analyses to gauge the extent of signal mixing in predictive models to help identify the brain-specific information captured by the model (more on that below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Conceptual framework\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing the impact of basic denoising via Autoreject VS ICA-based cleaning of bodily artifacts on the prediction performance of the classical covariance-based models from (David Sabbagh et al. 2020) and the ShallowNet (Schirrmeister et al. 2017) revealed a striking pattern (Figure¬†2). Some denoising improves model performance (especially for weak models) whereas ICA-based cleaning can hurt performance! What is behind that? Are those artifact components removed by ICA predictive?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: (Fig 2) Impact of preprocessing\n\n\n\nDeep dive via Figure¬†3. Just to be sure, Autoreject does not remove eye blinks whereas ICA does. This is seen most clearly on covariances and power topographies around 2Hz. So what is going on here? (Btw. an example of how our Morlet Wavelet approach allowed us to read out and compare different popular EEG descriptors for the same wavelets at the same frequencies).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: (Fig. S4) Impact of preprocessing on EEG features\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne way to figure out if artifacts are predictive is using ICA to isolate non-brain sources and reconstruct the same EEG features from that subspace. We see that artifact components show some co-variation with age and sex (Figure¬†4). As hypothesized, sex- and age-prediction is possible from those components. Calmingly, the performance for clean EEG is higher than for those artifact-derived EEG signals. Btw. if you are into stats, checkout our theoretical expansion of the Sabbagh et al.¬†generative model that we used to motivate this analysis, eqs. 1-3 & 14-15 in the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: (Fig. 4) Subspace estimation via ICA\n\n\n\nIf you have auxiliary channels (EMG, EOG, ECG, etc.), as was the case with the highly controlled EEG recordings from the TDBRAIN dataset, another route for probing this point is doing a same-analysis sort of approach ‚Äì as in (G√∂rgen et al. 2018)‚Äì by computing the same EEG features from those AUX channels (Figure¬†5). A similar story unfolds, pointing at predictive information in AUX channels, in particular EOG. Ok now you might think that what we see here is some imperfect subspace estimation, leading to residual brain signals on AUX channels or in ICA components. This cannot be entirely excluded but on the other hand, we have prior knowledge about body-signal changes in different medical conditions leading to changes in artifact load. A careful view would, hence, be to see these estimates here as some form of upper bound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5: (Fig. 5) Subspace estimation via AUX channels\n\n\n\nWe can regardless dig deeper and work harder to isolate specific artifacts (thank you unknown reviewers for motivating us!). Here we used the EOG channels in TDBRAIN to extract eye-blink times. We then use evoked-response methodology to suppress the non-timelocked background brain activity (Figure¬†6). We can then plug the EEG topographies at the maximum (which is the even time) into a linear decoder. To look behind trivial effects of blink-frequency, we repeat our analysis across subsamples of numbers of eye blinks and what we see remains the same: The spatial electrical propagation patterns induced by eye blinks are predictive of age and sex. (And the performance values fall within the upper bound provided by the previous analyses.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6: (Fig. 5) Isolation of EOG artifacts via time-locked analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime for looking at what else the tools powering our study can offer to support exploration. Here we benefit from the high-resolution grid of wavelets to explore the spectral specificity of our covariance-based prediction models (Figure¬†7). We can do that frequency-wise (individual, blue, left subplots) or pooling over 5 neighboring frequencies e.g.¬†for picking up predictive edge effects (average, orange, left subplots). Across tasks and datasets, using multiple neighboring frequencies adds information. However, we can rule trivial broadband effects (right hand, orange, average) as performance degrades substantially when averaging over frequencies. Moreover, combining all frequencies led to the best performance (right hand, blue, individual). While some information is concentrated between 4-16Hz, these results suggest that information is widely distributed for these tasks and may contain not only oscillatory information coming from brain-rhythms but also anatomical information revealed by the spatial patterns resulting from electrical propagation. On this point, check out the excellent study by (Jochmann et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7: (Fig. 6) Spectral profiling using Morlet Wavelets\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may wonder by now, how our covariance-based models with Morlet wavelets compare to previous versions using bandpass filtering in conventional frequency bands. We did not have a strong desired outcome here but loosely conjectured that continuous frequencies with log-linear smoothing via Morlet wavelet-families might provide a good prior for capturing the frequency-specific smoothness of brain rhythms. We see in practice (Figure¬†8 a) that decoding with Morlet wavelets most of the time was leading to improved performance! And the sensitivity analysis in figure (Figure¬†8 b) shows that this is not trivially driven by the increased number of frequencies coming with the wavelet approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†8: (Fig. S1) Wavelet performance VS bandpass filter\n\n\n\nThanks to one unknown reviewer, we even went the extra mile to see if this comes from the wavelet design itself (complex Gabor wavelet) or if it comes from logarithmic frequency placing and smoothing that defines Morlet wavelet families. To investigate this point, we computed another wavelet family with a linear frequency grid (hence no log-linear smoothing). Indeed, corroborating our initial intuition, the log-linear smoothing that comes with Morlet wavelets significantly improves performance (most of the time)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†9: (Fig. S2) Morlet wavelet performance VS linear spaced wavelets\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne more thing.

Since subtle changes in the brain precede a cognitive decline in healthy and pathological aging, our study predicts future decline as a continuous trajectory instead. Here, we tested whether baseline multimodal neuroimaging data improve the prediction of future cognitive decline in healthy and pathological aging. Nonbrain data (demographics, clinical, and neuropsychological scores), structural MRI, and functional connectivity data from OASIS-3 (N = 662; age = 46‚Äì96 years) were entered into cross-validated multitarget random forest models to predict future cognitive decline (measured by CDR and MMSE), on average 5.8 years into the future. The analysis was preregistered, and all analysis code is publicly available. Combining non-brain with structural data improved the continuous prediction of future cognitive decline (best test-set performance: R2 = 0.42). Cognitive performance, daily functioning, and subcortical volume drove the performance of our model. Including functional connectivity did not improve predictive accuracy. In the future, the prognosis of age-related cognitive decline may enable earlier and more effective individualized cognitive, pharmacological, and behavioral interventions."

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\n(from bioRxiv abstract)\nEEG is an established method for quantifying large-scale neuronal dynamics which enables diverse real-world biomedical applications including brain-computer interfaces, epilepsy monitoring and sleep staging. Advances in sensor technology have freed EEG from traditional laboratory settings, making low-cost ambulatory or at-home assessments of brain function possible. While ecologically valid brain assessments are becoming more practical, the impact of their reduced spatial resolution and susceptibility to noise remain to be investigated. This study set out to explore the potential of at-home EEG assessments for biomarker discovery using the brain age framework and four-channel consumer EEG data. We analyzed recordings from more than 5200 human subjects (18-81 years) during meditation and sleep, focusing on the age prediction task. With cross-validated R2 scores between 0.3 - 0.5, prediction performance was within the range of results obtained by recent benchmarks focused on laboratory-grade EEG. While age prediction was successful from both meditation and sleep recordings, the latter led to higher performance. Analysis by sleep stage uncovered that N2-N3 stages contained most of the signal. When combined, EEG features extracted from all sleep stages gave the best performance, suggesting that the entire night of sleep contains valuable age-related information. Furthermore, model comparisons suggested that information was spread out across electrodes and frequencies, supporting the use of multivariate modeling approaches. Thanks to our unique dataset of longitudinal repeat sessions spanning 153 to 529 days from eight subjects, we finally evaluated the variability of EEG-based age predictions, showing that they reflect both trait- and state-like information. Overall, our results demonstrate that state-of-the-art machine learning approaches based on age prediction can be readily applied to real-world EEG recordings obtained during at-home sleep and meditation practice."

Brain age is easily interpretable as ‚Äòhow old the brain looks‚Äô and could therefore be an attractive communication tool for brain health in clinical practice. This study aimed to investigate its clinical utility by investigating the relationship between brain age and cognitive performance in multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\n\nMethods\nA linear regression model was trained to predict age from brain magnetic resonance imaging volumetric features and sex in a healthy control dataset (HC_train, n =‚Äâ1673). This model was used to predict brain age in two test sets: HC_test (n =‚Äâ50) and MS_test (n =‚Äâ201). Brain-predicted age difference (BPAD) was calculated as BPAD = brain age minus chronological age. Cognitive performance was assessed by the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT).\n\n\nResults\nBrain age was significantly related to SDMT scores in the MS_test dataset (r =‚Äâ‚àí0.46, p &lt;‚Äâ0.001) and contributed uniquely to variance in SDMT beyond chronological age, reflected by a significant correlation between BPAD and SDMT (r =‚Äâ‚àí0.24, p &lt;‚Äâ0.001) and a significant weight (‚àí0.25, p =‚Äâ0.002) in a multivariate regression equation with age.\n\n\nConclusions\nBrain age is a candidate biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in MS and an easy to grasp metric for brain health."

    "text": "Summary\n(reprinted from abstract)\nVariable importance assessment has become a crucial step in machine-learning applications when using complex learners, such as deep neural networks, on large-scale data. Removal-based importance assessment is currently the reference approach, particularly when statistical guarantees are sought to justify variable inclusion. It is often implemented with variable permutation schemes. On the flip side, these approaches risk misidentifying unimportant variables as important in the presence of correlations among covariates. Here we develop a systematic approach for studying Conditional Permutation Importance (CPI) that is model agnostic and computationally lean, as well as reusable benchmarks of state-of-the-art variable importance estimators. We show theoretically and empirically that CPI overcomes the limitations of standard permutation importance by providing accurate type-I error control. When used with a deep neural network, CPI consistently showed top accuracy across benchmarks. An experiment on real-world data analysis in a large-scale medical dataset showed that CPI provides a more parsimonious selection of statistically significant variables. Our results suggest that CPI can be readily used as drop-in replacement for permutation-based methods.\n(Twitter/X)"

    "text": "Summary\n(reprinted from the article: ‚Äúbigger picture‚Äù)\nMagnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) can reveal neuronal dynamics non-invasively in real-time and are therefore appreciated methods in medicine and neuroscience. Recent advances in modeling brain-behavior relationships have highlighted the effectiveness of Riemannian geometry for summarizing the spatially correlated time-series from M/EEG in terms of their covariance. However, after artefact-suppression, M/EEG data is often rank deficient which limits the application of Riemannian concepts. In this article, we focus on the task of regression with rank-reduced covariance matrices. We study two Riemannian approaches that vectorize the M/EEG covariance between sensors through projection into a tangent space. The Wasserstein distance readily applies to rank-reduced data but lacks affine-invariance. This can be overcome by finding a common subspace in which the covariance matrices are full rank, enabling the affine-invariant geometric distance. We investigated the implications of these two approaches in synthetic generative models, which allowed us to control estimation bias of a linear model for prediction. We show that Wasserstein and geometric distances allow perfect out-of-sample prediction on the generative models. We then evaluated the methods on real data with regard to their effectiveness in predicting age from M/EEG covariance matrices. The findings suggest that the data-driven Riemannian methods outperform different sensor-space estimators and that they get close to the performance of biophysics-driven source-localization model that requires MRI acquisitions and tedious data processing. Our study suggests that the proposed Riemannian methods can serve as fundamental building-blocks for automated large-scale analysis of M/EEG."

An increasingly common approach for deriving such biomarkers is to train machine-learning models on a diverse set of neuroimaging features with the goal of accurately estimating a person‚Äôs biological age. Further, the difference between biological and chronological ages has been shown to be a useful metric that is sensitive to many phenotypes. However, no definitive guidelines exist to help researchers decide which set of neural properties would improve model accuracy and utility. Accordingly, we conducted a systematic review of multimodal brain age studies to identify which neuroimaging features provided the largest added value. We found that the multimodal models had an increased capacity to predict age, which did not translate to widespread improvement in clinical utility."
