# Brains, Biomarker & Cognition

:::{#hero-heading}

üß† Exploring the intricacies of the human brain through electrophysiology, imaging, and machine learning is my passion. I channel this enthusiasm towards the development of biomarkers and next generation therapeutics. In my current role at Roche Pharma Research & Early Development in Basel, I apply my expertise to assess the impact of novel compounds on brain dynamics and clinical outcomes, utilizing the knowledge, tools, and resources resulting of my research.

üñ•Ô∏è ‚öô Previously, at Inria in Saclay-√éle-de-France/Paris, I pioneered machine learning approaches bridging the gap between the laboratory and the real-world applications.
