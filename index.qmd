# Brains, Biomarker & Cognition

:::{#hero-heading}

I study the human brain using electrophysiology, imaging and machine learning to develop biomarker in next generation therapeutics and diagnostics.

In my current role at the Roche Pharma Research & Early Development in Basel, I work on assessing the impact of novel compounds on brain dynamics and clinical outcomes by applying knowledge, tools and resources resulting from my research.

Previously, at Inria (Saclay-Île-de-France / Paris), I have developed machine learning aproaches for bridging laboratory and real-world neuroscience.

My initial training is in experimental psychology & neuroscience.
