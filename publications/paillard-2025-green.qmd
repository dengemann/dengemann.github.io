## Our deep learning for exploring EEG biomarkers is out now in [Patterns](https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(25)00030-3)!

## Summary (in brief)

Our brains generate electrical signals
whose unique patterns reveal information
about aging, health, and even thoughts.
This information is useful for studying
brain disorders and developing novel
therapies. However, traditional analysis
methods can miss subtle but important
brain-activity patterns. GREEN,
introduced here, is an AI model that
readily decodes brainwave patterns. By
combining innovative mathematical tools
with deep learning, GREEN detects subtle
changes in brain activity with a low
computational footprint while providing
interpretable outputs that reveal insights
into brain function.
